INTRODUCTION
Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, affecting airline operations, passenger experience, and overall efficiency. This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of flight delays, capturing key factors such as departure and arrival times, airline performance, airport congestion, weather conditions, and air traffic control delays. By exploring these variables, the dataset aims to identify patterns and potential causes of delays, helping airlines, researchers, and policymakers develop strategies to improve on-time performance. Whether used for predictive modeling, operational analysis, or customer experience enhancement, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding and mitigating flight disruptions.

DATASET
The dataset was gotten from FP20 ANALYTICS – which a data challenge site. Upon getting the data I tried to understand the data before answering the business question(s) being asked. From the exploratory data analysis I carried out, I was able to gather that this was a flight performance data from the year 2023 – 2024. The first few columns show the total flights that arrived at that particular airport by an airline and from this value which flight was late as a result of NAS (National Aviation Systems), carrier reasons, late aircraft, security breach, and weather. And then the last few columns tell me how long each of those delays took (in minutes). To explain better, let’s take the first record which is for carrier ID Endeavor Air Inc. (9E) for January, 2024. It arrived at the Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE) with longitude (-75.442797) and latitude (40.651773) shows a total flights arrival of 44 and of this 44, 3 were delayed for more than 15 minutes. So that means the total number of flights delayed for >15 min was three for this particular record, 2 of which were delayed due to carrier’s reasons (caused by issues within the airline's control, such as maintenance, crew availability, and operational processes), 0 delays due to weather, National Aviation Systems (NAS), security breach, and 1 delay as a result of late aircraft. There were no flights scheduled for airport ABE that were canceled and did not take off and 1 flight was rerouted (diverted) to a different airport instead of their intended destination - Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE). These delays resulted in a total of 89-minutes wait time for the passengers because the previous flight arrived later than scheduled. Of this 89-minute delay, 56-minutes were as a result of the carrier’s reasons, none was caused by weather and security breach, 3-minutes delay caused by NAS, and late aircraft accounted for a 30-minutes delay.
